Microsoft.Web.Redis.RedisSessionStateProvider Nuget package has been added to your project.

A new <sessionstate> entry has been added to your web.config. However, any existing session state entries will not have been modified. 
If you believe you had an existing sessionstate entry, you will need to manually modify the web.config to make the Redis Session State Provider as the default.
