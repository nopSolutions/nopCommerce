       (postingsFormat/docValuesFormat). Note that most of the alternative implementations
       are experimental, so if you choose to customize the index format, it's a good
       idea to convert back to the official format e.g. via IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader)
       before upgrading to a newer version to avoid unnecessary reindexing.
       A "compressionMode" string element can be added to <codecFactory> to choose
       between the existing compression modes in the default codec: "BEST_SPEED" (default)
       or "BEST_COMPRESSION".

         Multipart File Uploads that Solr will allow in a Request.

         formdataUploadLimitInKB - specifies the max size (in KiB) of
         form data (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) sent via
         POST. You can use POST to pass request parameters not
         fitting into the URL.

         you want the value to exactly correspond to when the physical
         index was last modified.

         etagSeed="..." is an option you can change to force the ETag
         header (and validation against If-None-Match requests) to be
         different even if the index has not changed (ie: when making

       NOTE: The component registered with the name "debug" will
       always be executed after the "last-components"

  <!-- Add unknown fields to the schema

       Field type guessing update processors that will
       attempt to parse string-typed field values as Booleans, Longs,
       Doubles, or Dates, and then add schema fields with the guessed
       field types. Text content will be indexed as "text_general" as
       well as a copy to a plain string version in *_str.

       These require that the schema is both managed and mutable, by
       declaring schemaFactory as ManagedIndexSchemaFactory, with
       mutable specified as true.
