<!-- A 'dir' option by itself adds any files found in the directory
       to the classpath, this is useful for including all jars in a
       directory.

       When a 'regex' is specified in addition to a 'dir', only the
       files in that directory which completely match the regex
       (anchored on both ends) will be included.

       If a 'dir' option (with or without a regex) is used and nothing
       is found that matches, a warning will be logged.

       The examples below can be used to load some solr-contribs along
       with their external dependencies.

Add this Code:

<lib dir="${solr.install.dir:../../../..}/contrib/dataimporthandler/lib" regex="sqljdbc42*\.jar" />
<lib dir="${solr.install.dir:../../../..}/dist/" regex="solr-dataimporthandler-.*\.jar" />
