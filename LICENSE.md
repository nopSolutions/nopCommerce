# Commercial License

Independent Software Vendors that want the benefits of embedding nopCommerce software in their commercial applications but do not want to be subject to the nopCommerce Public License ("NPL") and do not want to release the source code for their proprietary applications must purchase a commercial license from the nopCommerce team. Purchasing a commercial license means that the nopCommerce Public License ("NPL") does not apply, and a commercial license includes the assurances that distributors typically find in commercial distribution agreements. If use of nopCommerce under the NPL does not satisfy your organization's legal department you should also enter into a commercial license agreement with the nopCommerce team.
